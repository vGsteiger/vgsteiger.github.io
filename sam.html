        <p>You may ask yourself, who is Sam the Giraffe, and what are they doing on this website? Well Sam is a Giraffe that I personally drew as part of my Bachelor's thesis. Sam has made their way into a PhD defense, into my Master's thesis and they will always have a place in my heart. Long live Sam!</p>
