    title: About Me
    summary: |
      Hey there, folks! I'm Viktor, and I'm here to spill the beans on my academic and professional journey. Currently, I'm knee-deep in the fascinating world of Data Management Systems at ETH Zürich, chasing that elusive Master's degree.

      You might also catch me working on my thesis, which is on the topic of Geo-Distributed Serverless Computing Systems at the University of British Columbia.

      When you don't find me in front of a computer screen, I'm probably out and about, exploring the world. I'm a big fan of hiking, and I'm always up for a good adventure. I also quite enjoy reading, and I'm always on the lookout for a good book recommendation. Please also feel free to reach out to me on Goodreads.

      I've been fortunate to try and test a variety of different things in my life, and I'm always looking for new challenges. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn. I am always happy to chat!
